# Tealog

## About this application
This is a console application based around information about tea.
It is meant to help the user keep track of teas that they have tried in the past.
It comes with an existing data set (a json file) of teas that I have tried in the past, but you can certainly change it to meet your needs!
The user can see information about existing teas in the data set, add their own teas, edit existing teas, and delete existing teas.

## How to use this application
Simply download or clone this repo, open the solution in Visual Studio, and click Run!
